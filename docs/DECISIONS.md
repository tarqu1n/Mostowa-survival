# Decision Log

Newest at the top. Each entry: what we decided, and *why*. Mark open questions clearly so a
future session knows what's still up for grabs.

Format: `YYYY-MM-DD — [DECIDED|PROPOSED|OPEN] Title` then a short rationale.

## 2026-07-11 — [DECIDED] Genre & platform: browser pixel-art survival base-builder

Single-player, runs in the browser, no server. Themed around Mostowa (camping destination).
Rationale: fun personal project; browser = zero-install, shareable by link; no backend keeps
it cheap and simple to host and reason about.

## 2026-07-11 — [DECIDED] Engine: Phaser 3

User's pick. Mature, huge tutorial/ecosystem base, first-class 2D + pixel-art support
(`pixelArt: true`, nearest-neighbour scaling), scene system suits a game with menus + world + UI.

## 2026-07-11 — [DECIDED] Build workflow: Hermes plan → critique → execute skills

Use the `hermes-ai-tooling` dev skills for every non-trivial feature so work is structured and
resumable across devices. See docs/WORKFLOW.md.

## 2026-07-11 — [DECIDED] Record-everything-in-repo rule

All reusable decisions/preferences/workflows are committed to the repo, never left only in chat,
because sessions hop between devices. This log is part of that.

## 2026-07-11 — [DECIDED] Language: TypeScript; Build tool: Vite

A survival/crafting game grows complex fast; types pay off in inventory/recipe/save code and make
cold-resuming on another device far easier. Vite gives instant HMR and a trivial static `dist/`
build that drops straight onto a static host.

## 2026-07-11 — [DECIDED] Hosting: GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions

Push to the deploy branch → Action runs `vite build` → publishes. Deploy config lives in-repo (no
external accounts), which fits the cross-device rule. itch.io kept in mind as an optional *second*
distribution target later for reaching players.

## 2026-07-11 — [DECIDED] Art pipeline: programmatic placeholders first

Start with generated/coloured-rect placeholder art so we can build and feel the mechanics quickly
(ideal for on-the-go sessions), then swap in real pixel art (free CC0 tileset and/or hand-drawn)
once the slice is fun. Keeps art off the critical path.

## Open questions

- **[OPEN] Skill loading across devices:** install the `hermes-dev` plugin via the `hermes-skills`
  marketplace vs vendoring skills into `.claude/skills/`. (Tracked in WORKFLOW.md.)
- **[OPEN] MVP vertical slice details:** exact mechanics/scope for the first playable — to be nailed
  down by a `plan-feature` plan. Draft slice is in GAME-DESIGN.md.
